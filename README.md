# QPALM

## Check out QPALM_vLADEL
Check out [this](https://github.com/Benny44/QPALM_vLADEL) for the main LGPL-v3 licensed version of QPALM based on LADEL. This repo is only maintained because it provides an interface also to CHOLMOD, which might be more useful than LADEL for dense problems.

A proximal augmented Lagrangian method for (possibly **nonconvex**) QPs using semismooth Newton direction and exact line search.

## Installation

### **Matlab**
* To install the mex interface of QPALM, add QPALM and its subfolders to the matlab path. Then run qpalm_make.m. You can test whether QPALM is working using 
the examples/qpalm_mex_demo.m and examples/qpalm_mex_nonconvex_demo.m.
### **C**
* To install a C-callable library, check [Bintray](https://bintray.com/benny44/generic/QPALM) for the binaries. These were compiled against [lapack](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lapack) from conda. So install miniconda and run the following commands
```
conda install -c conda-forge lapack
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path-to-miniconda/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path-to-qpalm-binaries/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
### **Python**
The python interface has been compiled for python version 3.7. If you want to use a different version, do your own install with the instructions on custom compilation below.

Follow the instructions for installing the C-library above. Then in an open terminal, do
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path-to-qpalm-binaries/interfaces/python/build/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
python3 path-to-qpalm-binaries/interfaces/python/qpalm_python_demo.py
```

### **Julia**
See [QPALM.jl](https://github.com/kul-forbes/QPALM.jl/tree/856c70d2be99a24e5d9a6391be45cf40c48947d4) for the instructions on installing the Julia interface.

## Custom Compilation
If you wish to do a custom compilation of the shared libraries, take a look at buildCustom.sh. First install the dependencies
```
conda install -c conda-forge lapack
```

Then change the following lines near the top of the script
```
export MINICONDA_LIB=path-to-miniconda/lib
export MINICONDA_INCLUDE=path-to-miniconda/include
```

Furthermore, change the cmake line to have whatever flags you want. To build the release version (with tests), use
```
cmake $curdir -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DCOVERAGE=ON
```
To build the python interface, use instead
```
cmake path-to-QPALM -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DINTERFACES=OFF -DUNITTESTS=OFF -DPYTHON=ON
```

Finally, run the buildCustom.sh script
```
chmod 755 buildCustom.sh
./buildCustom.sh
```

## Code Examples

Basic demos are available for the different ways to call the solver:
* For the mex interface of QPALM, check out examples/qpalm_mex_demo.m and examples/qpalm_mex_nonconvex_demo.m.
* For the C-version of QPALM, check out examples/qpalm_demo.c.
* For the python interface of QPALM, check out interfaces/python/qpalm_python_demo.py.
* For the Julia interface of QPALM, check out any of the files in interfaces/QPALM.jl/test/.

## Documentation

You can now find the the documentation [online](https://benny44.github.io/QPALM/).

## Tests

The QPALM library is tested extensively. The tests currently have [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Benny44/QPALM/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Benny44/QPALM?branch=master). To build the debug version and run the automated tests yourself, check out the custom compilation section above.

## Benchmarks

Check out the paper below for detailed benchmark tests comparing QPALM with state-of-the-art solvers.
