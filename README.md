A proximal augmented Lagrangian method for (possibly **nonconvex**) QPs using semismooth Newton direction and exact line search.

## Installation

* To install the mex interface of QPALM, add QPALM and its subfolders to the matlab path. Then run qpalm_make.m
* To install a C-callable library, check [Bintray](https://bintray.com/benny44/generic/QPALM) for the binaries. These were compiled against [suitesparse](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/suitesparse) and [lapack](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lapack) from conda.
* To use the Matlab version of QPALM, compile the CHOLMOD mex functions (suitesparse/CHOLMOD/MATLAB/cholmod_make.m), and run QPALM/matlab/mex/PWAlinesearch_setup.m. (The Matlab version is now also automatically setup when you run qpalm_make.m)

## Code Example

Basic demos are available for the different ways to call the solver.
* For the mex interface of QPALM, check out examples/qpalm_mex_demo.m and examples/qpalm_mex_nonconvex_demo.m.
* For the C-version of QPALM, check out examples/qpalm_demo.c.
* For the matlab version of QPALM, check out examples/qpalm_matlab_demo.m.

## Documentation

You can now find the the documentation [online](https://benny44.github.io/QPALM/).

## Tests

The QPALM library is tested extensively. The tests currently have [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Benny44/QPALM/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Benny44/QPALM?branch=master). To build the debug version and run the automated tests yourself, in <span>buildTest.sh</span> change 
```
export SUITESPARSE_ROOT_LIB=path/to/suitesparse_libs
export SUITESPARSE_ROOT_INCLUDE=path/to/suitespare_include
```
and then do
```
chmod 755 buildTest.sh
./buildTest.sh
```
