Description:
============

This test problem aims at regulating a chain of nine masses connected by 
springs into a certain steady-state. One end of the chain is fixed on a 
wall while the three velocity components of the other end are used as 
control input. Besides fixed lower and upper input bounds, also state 
constraints are included into the optimisation problem in order to ensure 
that the chain does not hit a vertical wall close to the steady-state. 
The prediction horizon of 16 seconds is divided into 80 control intervals. 
The model equations are derived from linearisation of the nonlinear ODE 
model (with 57 states) at the steady-state. Deviation from the 
steady-state, the velocities of all masses and the control action are 
penalised via the objective function.

In order to obtain the QP series we simulated in a closed-loop manner 
integrating the nonlinear ODE system to obtain the movements of the chain. 
Starting at the steady-state, a strong perturbation was exerted to the 
chain by moving the free end with a given constant velocity for 3 seconds. 
Then the MPC controller took over and tried to return the chain into its 
original steady-state while not hitting against the wall.
