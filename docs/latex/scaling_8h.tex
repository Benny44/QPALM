This file includes the routine that is called during setup to scale the problem data, and initial guesses if the problem is warm-\/started. Scaling the problem is useful to prevent large changes in the active set and to guard against ill-\/conditioning in the objective function. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The function in this file makes use of the cholmod scale routines.

Scale problem matrices. 

Ruiz scaling \cite{ruiz2001scaling} is applied to the constraint matrix A. This means that the rows and columns of A are scaled elementwise by the square root of their infinity norm, and this for a number of work-\/$>$settings-\/$>$scaling iterations. The resulting scaling can be written as $\bar{A}\leftarrow EAD$, where $E$ and $D$ are the row and column scaling diagonal matrices respectively. The upper and lower bounds are also scaled with $E$, thus $\bar{b}_\textrm{min}, \bar{b}_\textrm{max} \leftarrow E b_\textrm{min}, E b_\textrm{max}$. The primal variables are transformed using $D^{-1}$, resulting in $\bar{x}\leftarrow D^{-1}x$. Therefore, also the cost matrix Q and vector q have to be scaled with $D$, $\bar{Q}\leftarrow DQD$ and $\bar{q}\leftarrow Dq$. Finally the objective function is scaled with a scalar $c$, thus $\bar{Q}, \bar{q} \leftarrow c\bar{Q}, c\bar{q} $, where $c=1/\textrm{max}(1, \nabla f(x_0))$. The dual variables in the scaled problem become $\bar{y} \leftarrow c E^{-1} y$. The diagonals of $D$ and $E$ are stored and used in the remainder of the problem.
